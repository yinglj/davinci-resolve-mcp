---

## Supported Startup Modes (Protocols)

**DaVinci Resolve MCP Server** now supports three startup/connection modes (protocols):

| Mode/Protocol      | Description                                                     | Example Usage / Endpoint   | Authentication Support |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| `stdio`            | Run as a subprocess, communicating via standard input/output.    | `python src/main.py` or `./mcp-server` | None                  |
| `sse`              | Run as a network server using Server-Sent Events protocol.       | `http://localhost:8020/sse`| Bearer/Header/None    |
| `streamable-http`  | Run as a network server using HTTP with streaming responses.     | `http://localhost:8020/mcp`| Bearer/Header/None    |

**How to choose:**
- Use **`stdio`** when integrating as a local subprocess (e.g. for Cursor/Claude or embedded agent/server scenarios).
- Use **`sse`** or **`streamable-http`** when exposing the server over the network for remote or multi-client access.

**Authentication:**  
- Only `sse` and `streamable-http` modes support HTTP authentication (Bearer token, custom headers, or no auth).
- When using `stdio`, authentication is not used.

### Example (n8n node or client configuration):

| Protocol           | Endpoint/Command Example                | Authentication |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| stdio              | `python src/main.py`                    | None           |
| sse                | `http://localhost:8020/sse`             | Optional       |
| streamable-http    | `http://localhost:8020/mcp`             | Optional       |

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting guidance, refer to the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#troubleshooting) file which contains solutions to common issues.

### Common Issues

#### Path Resolution
- The installation scripts now use more robust path resolution, fixing issues with `run-now.sh` looking for files in the wrong locations
- Always let the scripts determine the correct paths based on their location

#### DaVinci Resolve Detection
- We've improved the process detection to reliably find DaVinci Resolve regardless of how it appears in the process list
- Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting the MCP server

#### Environment Variables
- Make sure all required environment variables are set correctly
- Review the log file at `scripts/cursor_resolve_server.log` for troubleshooting

### Windows
- Make sure to use forward slashes (/) in configuration files
- Python must be installed and paths configured in configs
- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server

### macOS
- Make sure scripts have execute permissions
- Check Console.app for any Python-related errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server

## Support

For issues and feature requests, please use the GitHub issue tracker.

## Launch Options

After installation, you have several ways to start the server:

### Client-Specific Launch Scripts

The repository includes dedicated scripts for launching with specific clients:

```bash
# For Cursor integration (macOS)
chmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start
./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start

# For Claude Desktop integration (macOS)
chmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start
./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start
```

These specialized scripts:
- Set up the proper environment for each client
- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running
- Configure client-specific settings
- Start the MCP server with appropriate parameters

### Pre-Launch Check

Before connecting AI assistants, verify your environment is properly configured:

```bash
# On macOS
./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh

# On Windows
./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat
```

These scripts will:
- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running (and offer to start it)
- Check environment variables are properly set
- Ensure the Python environment is configured correctly
- Validate Cursor/Claude configuration
- Optionally launch Cursor

### Universal Launcher

For advanced users, our unified launcher provides full control over both Cursor and Claude Desktop servers:

```bash
# Make the script executable (macOS only)
chmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh

# Run in interactive mode
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh

# Or use command line options
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor    # Start Cursor server (uses mcp_resolve-cursor_start)
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude    # Start Claude Desktop server (uses mcp_resolve-claude_start)
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-both      # Start both servers
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --stop-all        # Stop all running servers
./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --status          # Show server status
```

Additional options:
- Force mode (skip Resolve running check): `--force`
- Project selection: `--project "Project Name"`

## Full Installation

For a complete manual installation:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp.git
   cd davinci-resolve-mcp
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate it
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Alternatively, install MCP SDK directly
   pip install git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git
   ```

3. Set up DaVinci Resolve scripting environment variables:

   **For macOS**:
   ```bash
   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API="/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Scripting"
   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB="/Applications/DaVinci Resolve/DaVinci Resolve.app/Contents/Libraries/Fusion/fusionscript.so"
   export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules/"
   ```

   **For Windows**:
   ```cmd
   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API=C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\Scripting
   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB=C:\Program Files\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\fusionscript.dll
   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API%\Modules
   ```
   
   Alternatively, run the pre-launch check script which will set these for you:
   ```
   # On macOS
   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh
   
   # On Windows
   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat
   ```

4. Configure Cursor to use the server by creating a configuration file:

   **For macOS** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "davinci-resolve": {
         "name": "DaVinci Resolve MCP",
         "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For Windows** (`%APPDATA%\Cursor\mcp.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "davinci-resolve": {
         "name": "DaVinci Resolve MCP",
         "command": "C:\\path\\to\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
         "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\davinci-resolve-mcp\\src\\main.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Start the server using one of the client-specific scripts:
   ```bash
   # For Cursor
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start
   
   # For Claude Desktop
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start
   ```

## Usage with AI Assistants

### Using with Cursor

1. Start the Cursor server using the dedicated script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start
   ```
   Or use the universal launcher:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor
   ```

2. Start Cursor and open a project.

3. In Cursor's AI chat, you can now interact with DaVinci Resolve. Try commands like:
   - "What version of DaVinci Resolve is running?"
   - "List all projects in DaVinci Resolve"
   - "Create a new timeline called 'My Sequence'"
   - "Add a marker at the current position"

### Using with Claude Desktop

1. Create a `claude_desktop_config.json` file in your Claude Desktop configuration directory using the template in the `config-templates` directory.

2. Run the Claude Desktop server using the dedicated script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start
   ```
   Or use the universal launcher:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude
   ```

3. In Claude Desktop, you can now interact with DaVinci Resolve using the same commands as with Cursor.

## Project Structure

After cleanup, the project has the following structure:

- `resolve_mcp_server.py` - The main MCP server implementation
- `run-now.sh` - Quick start script that handles setup and runs the server
- `setup.sh` - Complete setup script for installation
- `check-resolve-ready.sh` - Pre-launch check to verify DaVinci Resolve is ready
- `start-server.sh` - Script to start the server
- `run-server.sh` - Simplified script to run the server directly

**Key Directories:**
- `src/` - Source code and modules
- `assets/` - Project assets and resources
- `logs/` - Log files directory
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts

When developing, it's recommended to use `./run-now.sh` which sets up the environment and launches the server in one step. 

## Changelog

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes. 

### Cursor-Specific Setup

When integrating with Cursor, follow these specific steps:

1. Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # From the davinci-resolve-mcp directory:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Note: This will install the MCP package and other dependencies automatically.

3. Set up the MCP server configuration in Cursor:
   
   Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` on macOS (or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` on Windows):
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "davinci-resolve": {
         "name": "DaVinci Resolve MCP",
         "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **Important Notes:**
   - Use `main.py` as the entry point (not `resolve_mcp_server.py`)
   - Use absolute paths in the configuration

4. Common issues:
   - "Client closed" error: Check that paths are correct in mcp.json and dependencies are installed
   - Connection problems: Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor
   - Environment variables: The main.py script will handle setting environment variables
